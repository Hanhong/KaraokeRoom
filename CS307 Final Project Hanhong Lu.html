    <h2>CS307 Final Project </h2>
    <h3>by Hanhong Lu</h3>
    <p>For my final project, I decided to use the door object I made earlier for creative scene.</p>

    <p>For my project, I decided to make an animation of a karaoke room. The door of the karaoke room opens, and then the camera moves towards the door and finally goes inside the room. There are two sofas and a tv inside the room. The tv is playing some music video (which sadly only has 6 frames). In addition, there are two spotlights flashing in the room.</p>
